# Data-Visualisation-Website
Front-end class project

This is a website being created on the topic of Data-Visualisation. All information, content (pictures, videos, texts) have been sited on the HTML files. 

The first HTML part mainly works on citing of information, implementing correct use of forms, element usage, symantecs, content usage, correct metadata insertion, and appropriate use of structural elements. 

The second CSS component implemented the styling and organisation of the content from the HTML. Additional div and span tags were added to the original html to allow correct organisation of the content. Using a fixed aside along with a more organised navigation bar, the website was aesthetically more pleasing. 

The third Javascript component implemented a comments section and a map section in the contact-form.html page. 

The comments section does not contain a database, so the comments would be deleted upon the refreshing of the browser. The comments would be organised in a way where the comments made by a specific user would be organised with his/her own comments. 

The maps section implemented the google maps API and browser location API. The initial longtitude and latitude location is a fixed location which would appear in the case when the user decides not to allow the location API to start upon the start of the browser. If the user did allow this feature, a location marker would appear at the user's latitude and longtitude location and the user would be able to click the marker to display his/her co-ordinates.
